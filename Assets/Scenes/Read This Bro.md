To keep our project organized and avoid commit conflicts, each member has their own independent scene folder.

ðŸš« Rules

Do not modify scenes that are not inside your folder.

Do not touch the Main Scenes folder at all.

You can copy other membersâ€™ scenes for reference, but edits must stay inside your folder.

ðŸ‘¥ Assignments

Map Builders â†’ put all progress inside Clark_Diaz Scene folder.

UI Designers â†’ work inside Gab_Daniel Scene folder.

Scripting Programmers â†’ use the scene with your name on it and do your coding there.


I will handle merging and moving approved scenes into the Main folder.
